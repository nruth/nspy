% a test double / mock process to use as a non-replying endpoint (null object) for messages
mock() -> new([]).


% a test spy to wrap another process, monitoring the messages sent to that process and relaying them to the intended receiver
% doesn't consider node failures or message synchrony, but you probably shouldn't be relying on that anyway.
